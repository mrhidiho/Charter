How to use
	•	Ensure your repo is public or that your org allows GHCR with GITHUB_TOKEN (default works).
	•	If you want to push to a different registry, edit IMAGE_NAME at the top of the workflow or pass it as a repo/Org secret.
	•	After pushing this repo to GitHub:
	•	Create a main branch and push.
	•	On PRs: CI will lint Helm and build the image (no push).
	•	On merges/pushes to main: CI will build and push your image to ghcr.io/<owner>/py-stack.
